<p>
I found the book moderately interesting. Maybe it's because I was already
familiar with the material at hand. Damian Conway is a good writer, and
his code examples are filled with interesting Perl techniques. Still, I
found that I needed a lot of discipline to continue reading the book.

<p>
I'd probably recommend the book for people who are new to Object Oriented
Programming, but not to people who are very familiar with it. Still, it's
a high quality book.
