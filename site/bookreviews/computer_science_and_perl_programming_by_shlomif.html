<p>
This is an all around nice book, that contains a selcted number of
articles from the Perl Journal among severall categories. Most of the
articles I read made a very nice read.
</p>
<p>
The first articles covered beginner concepts. They did not renew too much
to me, but I suppose they were well written. The next part was about
Regular Expressions and they were very nice and enlightening. The third
part covered various computer science issues, and was also very well
written and sometimes instructive, or just a good read.
</p>
<p>
I was not very consistent in reading the other parts, that covered
"Programming Techniques", "Software Development", "Networking",
"Databases" and "Internals". Most of what I read there (from what I was
interested in) was usually OK, and could provide a nice introduction to
the topic or technology it covers.
</p>
<p>
All in all, a very good read, and I believe everyone would find something
interesting here.
