Book Review "Mastering Algorithms with Perl"

First of all I'd like to note that I took a course about data
structures and algorithms in the course of my EE studies in the
Technion. Despite  that fact, I found the book to be quite interesting
and informative.  It taught me some things which I did not learn in the
course or before.

The book has its flaws though. For instance, it should cover
hash-related algorithms. Also, some issues such as Counting Sort or
BFS, should have received more focus in my opinion.

I think this book is especially useful for people who do not have any
formal education in Algorithmics and are not familiar with algorithms
in general. It can also be good for people who are, but who need a
working perl code or reference to such.

I liked the fact that the book had some funny anecdotes, which made its
reading even more enjoyable.

So, all in all a good book to read if one would like an introduction to
algorithms or even highlights from various specialized subjects.
