        <p>
        The book is written very professionaly and covers every last nuance of
        configuring Apache.  My main problem with it was that when trying to
        read it from cover to cover, it was quite boring.  Maybe I shouldn't
        have expected the Apache configuration voodoo to be overly fascinating,
        but the book insistence to cover every last configuration directive was
        a bit tedious.
        </p>

        <p>
        I learned a few new things by reading it, and some of the later
        chapters are more interesting as they cover general topics. I suppose
        that if you need to learn how to configure every last thing in Apache,
        then this book is for you. It may be a good read for everybody who wish
        to know what they can expect to find in the large amount of
        configuration directives.
        </p>

        <p>

                                          This is an all around nice book, that contains a selcted number of articles from the Perl
                                          Journal among severall categories. Most of the articles I read made a very nice read.<br />
                                          The first articles covered beginner concepts. They did not renew too much to me, but I suppose
                                          they were well written. The next part was about Regular Expressions and they were very nice
                                          and enlightening. The third part covered various computer science issues, and was also very
                                          well written and sometimes instructive, or just a good read.<br />
                                          I was not very consistent in reading the other parts, that covered "Programming Techniques",
                                          "Software Development", "Networking", "Databases" and "Internals". Most of what I read there
                                          (from what I was interested in) was usually OK, and could provide a nice introduction to
                                          the topic or technology it covers.<br />
                                          All in all, a very good read, and I believe everyone would find something interesting here.

Data Munging with Perl:
  author: David Cross
  book_cover_image: data_mun_with_perl.gif

    - review_content: |
        <p>

                                           This is the first Manning book I have read.<br />
                                           I am not sure why but I was looking forward to it with very high expectations -
                                           it was either because of the author or because of the nice and serious
                                           picture on the cover - and it delivered:<br />
                                           I learned a lot of new things and in areas where I already had some
                                           knowledge the book made order in the things I knew.
                                           <br />
                                           Manning books are a bit more expensive than other computer books and
                                           they cost me even more as it is not sold via Bookpool the usual place
                                           I buy books but the publisher was nice enough and sent a copy
                                           of this book free of charge to be reviewed by the
                                           <a href="http://perl.org.il/">Israeli Perl Mongers</a>.
                                           <br />
                                           <strong>munge</strong> - as also described in the book - means
                                           <strong>1.</strong> <em>[derogatory] To imperfectly
                                           transform information</em>
                                           but the book is about something slightly different: It is about taking
                                           some kind of input data and transforming it to another
                                           structure. Maybe it is actually the other meaning mentioned:
                                           <strong>3.</strong> <em>To modify data in some way the speaker doesn't need to go
                                           into right now or cannot describe succinctly (compare mumble)</em>
                                           <br />
                                           The word is somehow related to 'mangal' which is the word used in Israel
                                           for barbecue that of course means <strong>To take some raw material and
                                           make it digestible</strong>.
                                           <br />
                                           The book has four parts:<br />
                                           In the first part Dave gives us the
                                           <strong>Foundations</strong>: he gives us the basic background of data
                                           processing, the various sources and forms of data. He then goes
                                           on giving some guidelines on data structure design and
                                           best practices in data munging. This part already
                                           involves some interesting Perl expression. Then chapter 3-4 gives us
                                           the required Perl knowledge which is about intermediate level.
                                           It explains various methods for sorting and in 20 pages tries to teach
                                           pattern matching. This is definitely not enough for the beginners but then
                                           an intermediate Perl programmer already should know this level of
                                           pattern matching. I think this chapter about pattern matching is a bit
                                           misplaced but Dave might know that as he points us to other sources
                                           where we can get deeply involved with patterns.
                                           <br />
                                           The second part called <strong>Data Munging</strong> is the part that gave the
                                           title of the whole book. Here Dave gets a bit less generic and shows
                                           us how to can we read, transform and write 4 different data types:
                           </p>

                                           <ul>
                                           <li>unstructured data</li>
                                           <li>record-oriented data (variable-width data)</li>
                                           <li>fixed-width data</li>
                                           <li>binary-data</li>
                                           </ul>

                           <p>
                                           There are some nice tricks like keeping the field names in an array,
                                           using $/ in some unpredictable way and of course manipulating date and
                                           time. The binary section slightly touched the wealth of
                                           graphical file formats and gives you some directions to start.
                                           <br />
                                           <strong>Simple data parsing</strong> is the third part of the book. It goes into
                                           more specific data formats mainly HTML and XML and RSS.
                                           It shows a good example when NOT to use regular expressions for
                                           parsing data and then shows various tools and ways to parse these
                                           file formats.
                                           <br />
                                           In the last part there is an introduction to Parse::RecDescent a module
                                           that enables you to defined your own grammar and build your own parser
                                           for it.
                                           <br />
                                           <strong>The Big Picture</strong> is the last part of the book, it gives you an
                                           overview of the content of the book and mentions further resources
                                           where to seek help. Among other things Dave mentions the
                                           <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a> too. Did he know something
                                           ?
                                           <br />
                                           So the book provides you with various tools and shows quite a number
                                           of CPAN modules. Of course you'll still need to read the documentation
                                           to use the full power of the modules but the book gives you a good head
                                           start and points you in some of the good directions.
                                           <br />
                                           The text is quite readable but Dave will not make it as a
                                           thriller writer. In the paragraph where the title was
                                           "Making use of extra data" right from the title I could
                                           guess what will be the end of the story.
                                           <br />
                                           There is one really annoying issue that the book cover started to bend when I
                                           was about 5 minutes into reading the book. It certainly makes the book
                                           look as if I use it very often right at the beginning. You don't need
                                           that trick guys. I'll pick up the book quite often in any case.
                                           <br />
                                           Interestingly just as I was reading "Data Munging" I taught a Perl class
                                           where exactly some of the questions discussed in this book came up.
                                           <br />
                                           I warmly recommended this book.
                                           <br />
                                           Another review with some discussion can be found on

        <p>

                                         This is a nice book that covers many advanced techniques for writing Perl
                                         programs. It also discusses many caveats and gotchas of the language, and how
                                         to avoid them.
                                         <br />
                                         The book is quite old and many things it discusses have changed or have been
                                         updated since then. It is still mostly pertinent, however.
                                         <br />
                                         I already knew most of what the book had to say, so it did not renew too much
                                         to me. Still, I think it can be very suitable for Perl programmers who are
                                         relatively beginning in the language.
                                         <br />
                                        The style of the book is light and enjoyable which makes for a nice reading.

        <p>

                                           I got a copy of this book in one of the <a href="http://perl.org.il/">
                                           Israel Perl Mongers</a> meetings, to read and review it.
                                           <br />
                                           The topic is useful as this subject was considered as voodoo done by Perl hackers
                                           and "mappers of the Perl internals". I suppose you can say this claim is not true
                                           anymore, because this book collects the know-how from the perldocs, the newsgroups,
                                           the camel book (and other resources) and the personal experience of authors of the book.
                                           <br />
                                           Finally, you don't have to pick up small pieces of information about
                                           this subject in many places as people did prior to this book. What one
                                           would do, if one wanted to learn how to extend Perl or embed Perl
                                           before this book was available was doing one or more of the following:
                                           </p>

                                           <ul>
                                           <li> Read relevant small parts of the Camel book (preferably the
                                           recent edition rather than the 1st or 2nd) and "Advanced Perl
                                           Programming" (which is rather old, and only touches this matters).
                                           <br />
                                           This would give you some idea about Perl internals and perhaps some clues about XS,
                                           but that's about it.</li>
                                           <li> browse through newsgroups, mail archives and mailing lists to look for clues,
                                           and ask expert users, which usually, are not polite to answer newbies questions
                                           about such matters.</li>
                                           <li> figure out some cryptic (though, personally, I like them) incomplete (examples-wise)
                                           perldocs such as:<br />
                                                           perlembed, perldebguts, perlxstut, perlxs, <br />
                                                           perlclib, perlguts, perlcall, perlapi, <br />
                                                           perlintern, perliol, perlapio, perlhack</li>
                                           <li> locate and dig into available CPAN module using this technology.</li>
                                           </ul>

                           <p>
                                           I think reading one book, with common terminology and many examples, is better than doing
                                           one or more of the above.
                                           <br />
                                           The book starts with an introduction of C for Perl programmers. It is very short and in my
                                           opinion not so accurate (due to its shortness), but  since this should be a short introduction
                                           - it lives up to the promise. You can write a lot more than a "hello world" program after
                                           reading this short chapter, and you get a bonus, how to compile on gcc (gcc is ANSI-C and
                                           is available for all platforms), which is a wise idea. Perl programmers might be a bit
                                           disappointed to discover how much code and how complicated code you need to write in C to
                                           produce something that does the same as any Perl oneliner. The third chapter about Advanced
                                           C is a very good continuation to this introduction, especially, becuase the authors can assume
                                           you know some Perl (although I'm not sure they do). As someone giving lectures in "introduction
                                           to Computer Science, C language", I was tempted to borrow several very nice examples and
                                           explenations from this chapter. And I might also do that :-)
                                           <br />
                                           The next chapter explains how C code can be incorporated into a Perl Module and more generally
                                           into a CPAN package of a Perl module. This is very useful. Many resources (including books),
                                           focus on writing C/Perl code, and they say nothing or next to nothing about packaging (what
                                           you should do in order to make sure others can use your code, what you can and can't assume
                                           about the target system, etc.)
                                           <br />
                                           The fourth chapter is a useful cover of Perl variable types. This is somehting you could
                                           find in the "camel book", you can also find this in the (rather old) "Advanced Perl Programming",
                                           and of course in perldocs - but having it in one place, in order with examples and explenations
                                           is a real joy. Now you can figure it our reading one thing, and if you feel you want more, go
                                           to the perldocs.
                                           <br />
                                           Explaining Perl API, XS and advanced XS, alternatives to XS explain how you can add to your Perl programs some code (or programs or libraries) in C. I, personally wanted to have a module in Perl that gives interface to a data structure. Since the implementation I had is in C and it is tested and verified, I wanted to have a Perl module which exports the functionality, and offers a perl-oriented interface, without needing to reimplement the data structure in Perl. These book chapters made all the difference, and with the knowlede in chapter 2, I can now finish this, and after doing my testing, put it on CPAN. Isn't that great?!
                                           <br />
                                           If you are interested in doing the opposite, write Perl in C code, you can learn it in chapter 8.
                                           And if theory does not meet practice, you can read chapter 9 (and also try it out yourself)
                                           which presents a case study. Pretty useful stuff.
                                           <br />
                                           For people who are taking their first steps, the material so far is more than enough. But once
                                           you go deeper you want to know more about how to do more complicated stuff, and how stuff
                                           actually works. Chapter 10 which introduces you to the Perl internals is just what you would
                                           be looking for. Chapter 11 will be the tour into the depts, teaching you some perl hacking,
                                           i.e. how to alter Perl's behaviour.
                                           <br />
                                           The indices are useful, though can be found (though, not in similar format) elsewhere.
                                           <br />
                                           To sum this review, I loved the book. I wish I could take more time to practice what I read
                                           there thoroughly. I will surely get a copy of this book to have it on my bookshelf, and when
                                           the need comes, on my desk.
                                           <br />
                                           Another review with some discussion can be found on

        <p>

                                         This book is written relatively professionally, with many examples, an encompassing content.
                                         It is probably the definitive guide for people wishing to write extensions to the Perl
                                         language or to embed it in other applications.
                                         <br />
                                         However, I found that reading it from front cover to back coverm, it was most of the time
                                         very boring. Plus, sometimes code examples introduced various steps that need to be done
                                         relatively out of the blue, without a good motivation why. The style of the book in which
                                         examples have arrows that lead to remarks, and then bullets that are followed by end-notes,
                                         was also peculiar to me, but I suppose I got used to it.
                                         <br />
                                         I suppose that if you wish to write a Perl extension seriously, then buying this book would
                                         be a very good idea. Otherwise, you should probably not read it for fun.

'Games Diversions & Perl Culture: Best of TPJ':

        <p>
        The title of the book is a bit misleading. There is little
        about games, and a large part of it was the Perl knowledge
        quizes, and Perl obfuscated code contests which I decided to
        avoid. There is also not too much about Perl culture. A large
        part of the book is devoted to other things such as
        language programming in Perl.
        </p>

        <p>
        Nevertheless, this book contains a great deal of interesting
        articles, collected from the Perl Journal. Some articles I liked
        include:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        An essay by Larry Wall "Wherefore Art, Thou", that tries
        to find the musical equivalents of various programming
        angauges and concludes that Perl is akin to Cartoon music.
        </li>
        <li>
        "The Perl Journal Cover Art" which covers the covers (pun
                intended) of the early Perl journals. I especially liked
        the special Java edition that featured a cup of coffee with
        a cigarette butt inside. (and you can read some amusing
                comments that were received due to it)
        </li>
        <li>
        An article about Genetic Algorithms which is very
        enlightening.
        </li>
        <li>
        An article about the IRC Infobots.
        </li>
        <li>
        An article by Damian Conway about his sophisticated text
        autoformatting module.
        </li>
        <li>
        An article about the Rezrov Infocom game interperter,
        used to run legacy adventure games.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        And others...
        </p>

        <p>
        To sum up: a good book that any experienced Perl programmer
        will find many things interesting in.

        <p>
        I got a copy of this book in one of the Israel Perl Mongers meetings
        (<a href="http://perl.org.il/">perl.org.il</a>), to read and review it.
        </p>

        <p>
        This book is a loose collection of articles from <a
        href="http://www.tpj.com/">The Perl Journal</a>, a magazine
        specializing in Perl. The book is titled as "Best of the Perl Journal",
        and I support this title- I enjoyed reading the entire book, which
        covers a variety of topics, from Science to Poetry.
        </p>

        <p>
        Most O'Reilly titles are technical in nature, and at least for me those
        kinds of books are very hard to read from start to finish, as I quickly
        find entire chapters or even sections of the book irrelevant to my
        specific interest or simply written in a boring manner. Not so for
        "Games, Diversions and Perl Culture" - this light hearted book
        captivated me from the start,  even when reading articles about
        subjects which normally I wouldn't find interesting, such as Politics.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, even though it is not a reference or hard-core technical book,
        "Games, Diversions and Perl Culture" still managed to teach me a lot of
        interesting Perl, with all code examples being clearly and thoroughly
        explained. I especially liked the "Obfuscated Perl" section, I promise
        you that any Perl programmer that really tries to understand the code
        in this section will either get an immense headache or will gain a huge
        leap forward in his understanding of this powerful language and how to
        get the most out of it (in as little characters as possible) ;-)
        </p>
        <p>
        Since each article was written by an expert in that subject, "Games,
        Diversions and Perl Culture" has many articles but they are all of a
        high technical quality, something which would be impossible with a book
        with a single author who tried covering such a large variety of
        subjects. At the same time, even though it was written by many authors,
        the editor, Jon Orwant, did a great job in creating a book with a
        consistent feel and a generally high quality of writing.
        </p>

        <p>
        Most book reviews would at this stage stop being general and start
        going into specifics, but "Games, Diversions and Perl Culture" covers
        such a wide range of topics and does this so well that I really feel I
        would be wasting your time. Go to the <a
        href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/tpj3/">book's site</a>, download
        and read the sample chapters, peruse the table of contents and decide
        for yourselves whether you like it or not. If you're still hesitant at
        buying the book outright, I recommend trying out <a
        href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">Safari Bookshelf</a>, an electronic
        reference library which will, for a low price, let you read this and
        other books online, without having to pay the full price of a book.

Higher Order Perl:
  author: Mark Jason Dominus
  book_cover_image: ''
  book_reviews:
    - review_content: |
        <p>
        The noise about this book back when it was published sparked my interest,
        and I really wanted to read it. So I was happy when I received this book
        from the Israeli Perl Mongers library. It took me several months to read it
        and now's the time to review it.
        </p>

        <p>
        "Higher Order Perl" is both enjoyable and accessible. Mark Jason Dominus
        demonstrates some techniques that originated from the LISP world and shows
        how to implement them in Perl, and how they can be put into good use. I
        learend a lot from this book: how currying, iterators and streams can be
        useful, how a recursive descent parser can be implemented, and many other
        things.
        </p>

        <p>
        My main problem with the book was that I felt the examples became a bit
        disorganised as they were patched and new function arguments were added. But it
        does not detract much from an otherwise good book.

Mastering Algorithms with Perl:
  author: 'Jon Orwant, Jarkko Hietaniemi, Joh Macdonald'
  book_cover_image: ''
  book_reviews:
    - review_content: |
        <p>

                                           First of all I'd like to note that I took a course about data
                                           structures and algorithms in the course of my EE studies in the
                                           Technion. Despite  that fact, I found the book to be quite interesting
                                           and informative.  It taught me some things which I did not learn in the
                                           course or before.<br />
                                           <br />
                                           The book has its flaws though. For instance, it should cover
                                           hash-related algorithms. Also, some issues such as Counting Sort or
                                           BFS, should have received more focus in my opinion.<br />
                                           <br />
                                           I think this book is especially useful for people who do not have any
                                           formal education in Algorithmics and are not familiar with algorithms
                                           in general. It can also be good for people who are, but who need a
                                           working perl code or reference to such.<br />
                                           <br />
                                           I liked the fact that the book had some funny anecdotes, which made its
                                           reading even more enjoyable.<br />
                                           <br />
                                           So, all in all a good book to read if one would like an introduction to
                                           algorithms or even highlights from various specialized subjects.

        <p>

                                           This nice book that covers most of the main Computer Science topics is
                                           definitely a good gift for any Perl lover. The book popularly introduces
                                           a wide range of algorithms used in practice.
                                           <br />
                                           The authors describe different problems and suggest a number of algorithms
                                           for solving every problem. The weak and strong sides of all algorithms
                                           are examined together with their Perl implementations and benchmarks.
                                           It is an interesting mix of theory and practice, the computation theory
                                           is tested by practical benchmarks.
                                           <br />
                                           The book will give you many hours of interesting reading regardless of
                                           your current theoretical baggage. Those who learned Computer Science in
                                           a high school, will refresh the knowledge and review the theory again,
                                           this time from the Perl point of view. Those who are beginners to the
                                           topics will discover an interesting world of mathematical algorithms.
                                           Efficient data storage, sorting, numeric analysis, compilation theory,
                                           probability, cryptography, graphs and much more.
                                           <br />
                                           It is nice to confirm once again that Perl not only does not stay on the
                                           way of theory, but naturally describes it, making algorithm implementation
                                           clear and intuitive. This is especially noticeable for folks familiar with
                                           algorithm implementations in other programming languages.
                                           <br />
                                           The book uses a large number of convenient CPAN modules. Funny quotes
                                           make this book even more thrilling. I will definitely acquire this book
                                           for my home library on a good occasion.
                                           <br />

Object Oriented Perl:

  book_reviews:
    - review_content: |

        <p>
        I found the book moderately interesting. Maybe it's because I was
        already familiar with the material at hand. Damian Conway is a good
        writer, and his code examples are filled with interesting Perl
        techniques. Still, I found that I needed a lot of discipline to
        continue reading the book.
        </p>

        <p>
        I'd probably recommend the book for people who are new to Object
        Oriented Programming, but not to people who are very familiar with it.
        Still, it's a high quality book.
        </p>

Oracle SQL*Plus (Pocket Reference):
  author: Jonathan Gennick
  book_cover_image: ''
  book_reviews:
    - review_content: |
        <p>

                                           When you read a book review it is also important to know the
                                           background of the reviewer. It is important to know his point
                                           of view. So here is mine:
                                           <br />
                                           I have been working with databases for a couple of years now but I am
                                           not a DBA and in most of the cases I use Perl to access the database.
                                           I touch the user interface of the database mainly to try SQL
                                           statements and to debug my application. I have been using Oracle
                                           for a couple of monthes now as I am writing a Perl application with
                                           Oracle back-end.
                                           <br />
                                           This booklet is divided into two parts. The first 60 pages cover
                                           mainly the Oracle SQL and the next 50 pages are the SQL*Plus command
                                           reference. It covers Oracle 8 and Oracle 9i with clear marking
                                           which command is available only in the new version of the database.
                                           <br />
                                           Going through the book gave me an opportunity to learn about a number
                                           of SQL statements that are not available in other databases. Of course
                                           you don't get any deep understanding of commands but you get the idea
                                           and this helps later. Among lots of other details I read about
                                           number and date formating which already saved me some time when I
                                           needed that info a few days later.
                                           <br />Actually - and this should be another disclaimer - I am not a fan
                                           of Pocket Reference books. I think their content should be part of the
                                           help available with the application. But I had to wait in
                                           a queue for 3 hours somewhere so it was also a life saver that I could
                                           have this booklet with me.
                                           <br />
                                           In general I recommend this book if you are a new or practicing Oracle DBAs
                                           and if you are not satisfied with the on-line help
                                           or if you are a database programmer and need a quick overview of the
                                           Oracle SQL and the command line interface to the database.

Perl & XML:

        <p>

                                         This book covers the basics of how to work with XML technologies using Perl. It is written
                                         in a light style and is filled with jokes and funny examples. This makes reading it very enjoyable.
                                         <br />
                                         This book covers XML basics, the common XML parsers avialable for Perl (in both the event streams
                                         and trees variants), some related technologies like XPath and XSLT, as well as some
                                         applications of XML. It does not aim to be a comprehensive resource for learning about
                                         them, but is a very good introduction, and I learned some new things by reading it.
                                         <br />
                                         All in all, a very good read. Highly recommended.

Practical mod_perl:

        <p>
        This book is really good. It covers most of the issues one
        can encounter in managing and programming for a
        mod_perl-based web-server. It gives many tips, tricks and
        guidelines and is very encompassing.
        </p>
        <p>
        Despite its length, this book kept me captivated most of
        the time and I highly enjoyed reading it. The only thing
        that disappointed me was that there wasn't a detailed
        guide to the mod_perl API. Perhaps it is covered in other
        books, and not in the scope of this book.
        </p>
        <p>
        All in all - highly recommended. You can
        <a href="http://modperlbook.org/">read it online on its
        home-site</a>.

        The Camel Book is O'Reilly's crown Jewel, and after I read it I
        understood that it was from a very good reason. The book is very
        informative, occasionally funny or whimsical, and covers every last
        caveat of the perl 5.6.x interpreter. It covers major issues in dealing
        with Perl (both simple use and advanced) and references to many CPAN
        modules and extensions. It covers Perl 5.6.x so it is very up-to-date.
        </p>

        <p> I liked the book so much that I think I'll have to buy it, because
        I can't remember everything it said there, and I might run into a need
        of using them. I skipped some sections (like the perlfunc equivalent
        one), but as a general rule read everything and most sections were very
        good and enlightening.  </p>

        <p> I would not recommend it for very beginners because it often relies
        on information that will be taught only later on. People who are
        familiar with similar languages like Common Lisp, Python, or whatever,
        may find it useful as well.  </p>

        <p> "Programming Perl" is a very good book. If you can buy the Perl CD
        Bookshelf which includes it and other important titles for your
        organization, do so, and if you like dead tree (or hopefully dead
        cannabis) books it will make an excellent read.

        </p>

'Refactoring - Improving The Design of Existing Code':
  author: Martin Fowler
  book_cover_image: ''
  book_reviews:
    - review_content: |
        <p>

                                        <a href="http://www.refactoring.com/">Refactoring</a> is improving the internal design
                                        of a code without changing its external behaviour. This book is the definite
                                        guide to refactoring, at least in object-oriented systems.
                                        <br />
                                        The first chapters of the book are rather general. They introduce the
                                        motivation for refactoring, why it is good, why it actually speeds up
                                        development. Also, they also give a list of "bad smells" in the code
                                        that indicate that a refactoring is needed. (like duplicate code).
                                        <br />
                                        The middle part of the book which is its lion's share is a catalog of
                                        various refactorings. These are things like extracting a method, creating
                                        a superclass, eliminating inheritance, or creating one. The author explains
                                        there each refactoring, when to do it, the steps for performing it most
                                        safely, and then usually gives an example of how to do it. I found the
                                        catalog a bit tedious to read, but interesting nonetheless. It taught
                                        me some new techniques that I was not previously aware of.
                                        <br />
                                        The final chapters wrap up the book, and are also interesting to read. They
                                        consist of an essay by William Opdyke (who wrote a very early research paper
                                        on refactoring) titled "Refactoring, Reuse and Reality", a chapter about
                                        <a href="http://www.refactoring.com/tools.html">Refactoring Tools</a>, and a short
                                        summarizing chapter by Kent Beck.
                                        <br />
                                        The book smells a bit of hype: Java is used as the example language (albeit
                                        its use there is quite justified); there are many UML diagrams (which were
                                        at first confusing to me due to the many kind of arrows they have); and there
                                        are references of several of the so-called Design Patterns. (from the Gang
                                        of Four book and otherwise). But they don't detract much from an
                                        otherwise good book.
                                        <br />
                                        The book can also be used as a reference to look for refactorings or see
                                        how can they be performed well. I think this book has made me more conscious
                                        of how I refactor and write code, and I try to refactor in a way that will
                                        minimize the errors caused by it. I'm also now more aware of the "two hats",
                                        as Fowler puts it, of either refactoring code or adding new features.
                                        <br />
                                        To sum, this is a very good and important book to read, especially for
                                        beginning programmers. I'm just not sure it justifies the $54.00 list
                                        price. This is too much of a price for such a book.

Running Weblogs with Slash:

  book_reviews:
    - review_content: |

        <p>
        <a href="http://www.slashcode.com/">Slash</a> is a Perl-based framework
        that powers <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> and other
        similar news sites. It supports placing articles, commenting (and
        commenting on comments), rating other people's comments, web-boxes with
        links, user blogs, and has many available plug-ins, themes and
        customizations.
        </p>

        <p>
        This book written by some of the Slash developers forms a good
        coverage of Slash. It explains the basic concepts behind it, and how to
        set it up, how to configure it, and how to customize it. If you need to
        set up a site like Slashdot, then this book is definitely for you.
        </p>

        <p>
        The style of the book is not too high and entertaining. Some parts
        are also very funny.

User Friendly the comic strip:
  author: J. D. Illiad Frazer

  book_reviews:
    - review_content: |
        <p>

                                           When I received the leadership of the Israel.pm Perl Mongers group I
                                           also received a couple of books. There was one about Windows NT Logons,
                                           one abut IMAP, The User Friendly book and even some about Perl.<br />
                                           The previous group leader received these books from O'Reilly in the hope
                                           that he and others in his group will write reviews about the books but
                                           AFAIK no review surfaced yet.<br />
                                           So now as I'd like to encourage others in our group to write reviews I
                                           guess I should show some good example. All this was about 10 days
                                           before one of our meetings so I had to do it quickly.
                                           <br />
                                           After going over the titles it was easy to decide which book to pick.
                                           <br />
                                           I have looked at <a href="http://www.userfriendy.org/">User Friendly</a>
                                           comic strips earlier but I did not have the patience to read them
                                           on-line or to follow them on a daily basis. Having a book is so
                                           much different.
                                           <br />
                                           This way you get a huge dose of it at once. You can read it at once
                                           though other reviews suggest you should read it slowly. I guess
                                           it is up to you. (Does TIMTOWTDI apply here ?)
                                           <br />
                                           Anyway I wanted to give a 5-minute review of the book and I hope
                                           that from now on every <a href="../meetings.html">meeting</a> we have
                                           we'll have one 5-minute review of the book.<br />
                                           I had no idea what really to talk, I thought saying things about the
                                           cartoon is silly but I got the impression that most of the people had
                                           no clue what User Friendly is and were surprised to see a cartoon in
                                           our library. So a few words about the characters needed.
                                           <br />
                                           User Friendly is a commic strip by Illiad that has started some time
                                           in 1997 and was describing the way of life of ISPs (Internet Service
                                           Providers), support team, system administrators and the like. It has
                                           a strong affiliation with the Open Source community and sees
                                           Microsoft and similar companies as the enemy.<br />
                                           There is also this techies versus marketing type people in the book.
                                           Guess about whom are the jokes.<br />
                                           This book is a thriller at Columbia Internet - the ISP. You have every
                                           ingreedients. Murder, love, rescue operation, Dust puppy.
                                           <br />
                                           Some of the text is written in the jargon of the community and some of
                                           the English is not that easy to understand for someone who does not
                                           live in it. Nevertheless you'll probably understand most of it.
                                           <br />
                                           You can get a taste of it by looking at <a
                                           href="http://www.uerfriendly.org/">userfriendly.org</a> or you can even
                                           see all the earlier parts in the archive there but who wants to sit
                                           in front of the computer all the time ?<br />
                                           So I think it is worth to buy the book if only for the relaxation of
                                           your eyes.
                                           <br />
                                           I am not the marketing type but still I though I should write the
                                           usual hype so think about it this way. The book costs only US $12.95 !!
                                           <br />
                                           There are about 120 pages in the book so it is only 10c/page !
                                           <br />
                                           Going even further you can see that there is an average of 9.3
                                           pictures per page. That means you get the book for only 1c/picture !!
                                           <br />
                                           That's about the level I can get in marketing. In order to balance it
                                           here are some scientific methods to compare this book with another one
                                           in our library:
                                           <br />
                                           People say that a picture is worth 1000 words.
                                           There are 120 pages, about 9.3 pictures per page so they are worth
                                           9.3*1000*120 = 1_116_000 words in the book.<br />
                                           Compare that to this other book I have received: "Windows NT Logons".
                                           It has about 15 words a line, aprox. 40 lines a page and has 210
                                           pages.
                                           <br />
                                           That is 15*40*210 = 126_000 words.
                                           <br />
                                           So User Friendly has nearly <strong>10 times more</strong> words in it !
                                           <br />
                                           For a fraction of the cost....
                                           <br />

        <p>

                                           When I first sat down and opened "User Friendly the comic strip", by Illiad, I
                                           was skeptical. What could a comic strip aimed mainly (it seemed to me) at ISP
                                           workers, mean to someone who was not?
                                           Could I relate or would the jokes be flat and boring?
                                           <br />
                                           To my surprise and joy, User Friendly turned out to be even better than I
                                           had hoped. A single comic strip tells a very short story. Several comic strips
                                           can expand on that story and make it into something better. But an entire book
                                           on the same comic strip does something wonderful- it fills out the story, turns
                                           what might have been a short and indecipherable joke into a cast of characters
                                           you can relate to, a story you can understand, and an experience to be
                                           cherished.
                                           <br />
                                           I wish I could tell you I had a favorite joke or character (well, okay, the Dust
                                           Puppy is *way* cool, but I liked The Chief too, so it's a close call). They are
                                           all pretty good, and I can guarantee that the jokes will have you ROTFLOL after
                                           a few pages. If, that is, you understood what I just wrote.
                                           <br />
                                           You see, there is a little catch- you have to be "in the know", at least a
                                           little bit, in order to understand what the jokes are all about. This is, after
                                           all, a comic book aimed mainly at the geek crowd, so someone who does not
                                           understand the terminology used or has never helped a truly clueless user will
                                           have trouble understanding or relating to some of the jokes.
                                           <br />
                                           That aside, if you are from the field of computers, I promise you hours of fun,
                                           even if you don't grok Quake :-)
                                           <br /> In short, I warmly recommended this book.

Using Samba:
  author: 'Robert Eckstain, David Collier-Brown, Peter Kelly'

        <p>

                                           "Using Samba" can be seen as THE fundamental book for Samba administrators.
                                           It covers the download, installation and configuration of the server. You will find
                                           instructions for Windows 95/98,
                                           NT and Linux. It goes on a step by step trip over disks shares, users
                                           securities and printer sharing.
                                           <br />
                                           From my point of view, the 40 or so pages dedicated to troubleshooting are
                                           worth the whole book.
                                           <br />
                                           Installing and configuring Samba has become a somehow simple task, specially
                                           considering high level administrative interfaces like SWAT or Webmin. However,
                                           when it comes the time for troubleshooting, most of the times, you are alone.
                                           "Using Samba" gives you the right support for this difficult task, with a simple
                                           and complete step-by-step guide for finding the source of the problem and ideas
                                           for solving it.
                           </p>
                                           <ul>
                                           <li>Chapter 1 introduces Samba and shows what the software package can do for your network.</li>
                                           <li>Chapter 2 demonstrates downloading, installing, and testing Samba on a UNIX system. </li>
                                           <li>Chapter 3 contains instructions for configuring some Windows clients to use Samba. </li>
                                           <li>Chapter 4 has the basic options for configuring disk shares in Samba are explored. </li>
                                           <li>Chapter 5 covers browsing, filesystem differences and file permissions on Windows and Unix.</li>
                                           <li>Chapter 6 examines Samba security features like users, groups, and passwords. </li>
                                           <li>Chapter 7 documents printing and name resolution with Samba. </li>
                                           <li>Chapter 8 contains additional Samba information mainly for programmers. </li>
                                           <li>Chapter 9 presents Samba troubleshooting ideas and resources. </li>
                                           <li>Appendices describe SSL, performance tuning, commands, and Samba quick reference data.</li>
                                           </ul>

                           <p>
                                           Though the book is starting to show its age (Windows XP is missing), it remains a
                                           useful guide for those looking to learn about resource sharing with Samba.
                                           <br />
                                           Even when you can download an HTML version of the book from <a href="http://samba.he.net/">
                                           http://samba.he.net/</a>, it is still worth to buy the book.
                                           <br />Another review with some discussion can be found on <a

                                           I have bought this book about a year ago but now that our Perl Mongers
                                           group have received a free copy of it from New Riders I decided I
                                           write down what I thought about the book. If for nothing else then to
                                           suggest to my fellow Perl Mongers that they should read it and
                                           throroughly review it.
                                           Mine is not going to be thorough review just a few quick notes.
                                           <br />
                                           This book can be used both as a reference book and as a tutorial. When I
                                           received it I went through most of the 720 pages of the book and later
                                           I kept returning to it to look up various items.
                                           <br />
                                           If you are a Windows system administrator or the guy who is supposed
                                           to do all kind of magic on the local system (like collecting data from
                                           various computers or looking into various files in all kinds of
                                           formats) then this is going to be very useful to you as well.
                                           <br />
                                           The good thing about this book is that you don't have to read it
                                           sequentially. After reading the Introduction I started with chapter 4
                                           about File Management and later returned to the preceeding
                                           chapters. You can also jump straight to the area you try to explore.
                                           <br />
                                           Most of the modules in the Win32::* namespace do not have much
                                           documentation. This book solves this problem by discussing several
                                           modules in depth, explaining how they work and what are the parameters
                                           you can use for the various functions. There are lots of examples
                                           (also downloadable from the <a href="http://www.roth.net/">author's
                                           site</a>). Though there are a few mistakes in the examples they can
                                           be discussed on the various mailing lists of ActiveState where
                                           sometimes Dave Roth, the author of the book himself answers the
                                           questions.
                                           <br />
                                           There is a good introduction to OLE automation and of course how to
                                           do it with Perl and an explanation of how to write DLLs along with
                                           details about Perl internals something I cannot evaluate as I have
                                           not tried it yet.
                                           <br />
                                           I think this book is a must for everyone who wants to write
                                           something deeper in windows than processing INI files.

Writing Perl Modules for CPAN:
  author: Sam Tregar
  book_cover_image: ''
  book_reviews:
    - review_content: |

        <p> The book as a whole is written well and contains some useful
        information, especially for people who are not very knowledgable in the
        subject.  The style is light and semi-informal which makes for a very
        easy and enjoyable read.  </p>

        <p> The first chapter of the book introduces the reader to <a
        href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> and how to effectively use it. It
        is a good introduction, but did not teach me a lot of new things.  </p>

        <p> The second chapter covers the basics of writing Perl modules.  I
        skipped this chapter because I evaluated myself as familiar enough with
        these technicalities.  If you'd read it, you'd be able to comment on
        how well it explained things you already know.  That's often valuable
        in book reviews.  </p>


        <p> The third chapter covers some guidelines for good modules design
        and implementation.  I found this chapter very good as well, and may
        have  learned a few things from it.  </p>

        <p> The fourth chapter covers the technicalities of building a CPAN
        Module distribution.  Here, I learned several new things which I did
        not already know, some of which will make my life much easier in the
        future.  </p>

        <p> The fifth chapter covers sumitting the module to CPAN, which
        basically covered the PAUSE  technicalities. It was also quite good,
        but did not renew much to me.  </p>

        <p> The sixth chapter covers module maintenance and the seventh one
        overviews some great CPAN modules. They are both quite good.  </p>

        <p> I skipped the next three chapters because they dealt with  writing
        C extensions.  This is due to the fact I'm now reading "Extending and
        Embedding Perl " which covers the topic more thoroughly.  The last
        chapter ("CGI Application Modules for CPAN") introduces the reader to
        the CGI::Application module and how to effectively use it.  It was
        good, and I finally, understood what CGI::Application was all about.  I
        was a bit disappointed by the book, because I expected to find some
        very high wisdom on writing CPAN modules. But I  guess no such thing
        exists besides what the book covers, and so the entry level to becoming
        a good CPAN contributor is lower.  So, all in all, a great book.  </p>
