    <p>

             One month after the conference I was expecting some 20-30 people to
             come and indeed about 20 wrote to me but in the end we were only 14.
             The rest, what can I say, you missed a very good meeting !<br />
             Several people who attended told me they think this was one of
             the best meetings so far and I was glad to hear that.<br />
             We had a fair mixture of simple and complicated things.<br />
             This time <a href="http://www.d.co.il/">Dapey Zahav</a> provided us with
             their presentation room, which is actually their bomb shelter.
             <br />
             <strong>use safe;</strong><br />
             <br />
             They have the tables arranged in U shape which makes communication
             between the people much better. Indeed we had interesting discussion
             about the subjects.
             <br />
             We have also received refreshment from Dapey Zahav, so we filled
             ourself with all kinds of cookies. Shlomi brought sugar-free
             things for himself.<br />
             We touched Configuration Management issues (even before Shlomi got
             there !) and I showed how I am trying to use VMware to run Windows
             on my Linux machine with NAT. It will be really cool once I can
             configure it.<br />
             <br />
             <strong>Roey Almog</strong> started his presentation at 19:00. It was very interesting to see
             how an otherwise C++ programmer picked up Perl and used it to process
             30.000 word files. It was really nice to see how he did not want to
             solve all the problems around the issue but looked for a workaround
             wherever needed (e.g. the memory leaking issue). If you missed it you
             can read his slides here:
             <a href="/presentations/roey_almog_search_engine.pdf">Roey Almog: Search engine that indexes MS-Word documents</a><br />
             <br />
             After a short break <strong>Ran Eilam</strong> took over the projector and gave us a
             very clever presentation about data persistence.<br />
             First he introduced us to the problems in large scale Business
             projects, the fact that some 40% of your perl code will actually end
             up being SQL queries. How various modules on CPAN try to solve the
             problem of data persistence and why they don't really do a good job.
             Finally and for most of his presentation he showed us how to write a
             very simple Object Oriented application using
             <a href="http://www.soundobjectlogic.com/tangram/">Tangram</a><br />
             I enjoyed his presentation style very much and you can see he
             has lots of things to say on the subject. Ran was wondering why in
             Perl there is only one such implementation while in Java - where it
             is much more difficult to implement such things there are dozens of
             similar environments.<br /> We are not sure if the lack of OO persistence
             systems in Perl is the cause or the result of the relatively low
             number of business systems written in Perl. Nag him for the slides.<br />
             <br />
             After another short break I (<strong>Gabor Szabo</strong>) took the virtual microphone
             and started to give my half written presentation about debugging in
             Perl. It turns out that only 3 or 4 of the 14 people present use a
             debugger (if you can guess the names correctly you'll get a present)
             the rest use print statements. This is in a group where most of the
             people consider them self experts. (I don't want to tell you what we
             really are :-). So I think teaching people all kinds of debugging
             techniques was a good choice to propose on <a
             href="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/">YAPC::EU::2003</a> and my talks were indeed accepted.<br />
             <br />
             Anyway, while I was presenting I think most of the talking was done by
             the audience and I personally learned quite a lot from this
             presentation. We talked about why adding print statements is a bad
             thing on the long run and Ran mentioned that he thinks if you need
             some complicated part of the debugger it means you actually should
             have written mini-tests for your code. I don't fully agree with the above
             but you do have to write tests for your code. (remind me that I should
             also :-)<br />
             <br />
             I briefly even showed the built in debugger itself and ptkdb and the
             ppl. could take a look at the set of pictures I am preparing for the
             pure people in Paris. There are not many slides as a large part of the
             presentation is actually live demo (of bugs). Whatever I have will be
             published some time close to YAPC::EU.<br />
             <br />
             All in all I think this was a good meeting.

             Stas brought us a copy of his book and the printout that participants in his
             OSCON mod_perl 2.0 tutorial received. They are both very big.<br />
             In return we gave him a T-shirt and the proceedings of our conference. They were
             both rather thin.<br />
             <br />
             While we were still waiting for more people to arrive we asked him about Australia
             where he lives now and I asked him how does he make a living from Perl. As it turns
             out for <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/">Ticketmaster</a> mod_perl
             is such a critical tool that they are ready to finance him and let him develop
             mod_perl 2.0 so it will be ready faster and be better without putting any constraints
             on him, not even his location. That's very clever of them. I wish Israeli
             companies would also recognize that supporting open source development pays off
             for them as well as they will get more reliable tools faster. Even small
             things like supporting our conference helps a lot.
             (<a href="/YAPC/2003/sponsors.html">see which Israeli companies are clever</a>)<br />
             <br />
             Stas started slowly with showing installations and basic mod_perl handlers
             including Registry modules. Then he went through the stages of an HTTP request
             that arrives at an Apache server and goes through it and showed us examples for each
             step. Once he finished this he went into building filters and protocol handlers.<br />
             <br />
             More you can get from his slides or by buying his book (see below).<br />
             <br />
             As next month I won't be in Israel, Shlomo has taken it upon himself to organize
             <a href="20030814.html">the next meeting</a>. <br />
             As he is also organizing the place for the next meeting, it will
             be in the University of Haifa in CRI, the same place where we had the conference
             in May.

    <p>

             We met at Dapey Zahav at around 18:00. At the beginning there was
             only Ran Eilam, Mikhael Goikhman and I. After a while Ronen Kfir
             came and afterwards other people. We talked outside on various
             subjects including holding a persistent connection on HTTP/1.1,
             Subversion and Freecell.<br />
             <br />
             There were some problems in getting the laptop to do demonstrations.
             While the web worked fine, we could not get SSH and Telnet to work
             (apparently, the ports were blocked by the firewall). Eventually,
             Itzik Lerner brought a laptop of his own, which had perl installed
             on it, which solved our problems.<br />
             <br />
             I started with a lecture about finding the Graham Function. It involved
             some concepts from Number Theory and Linear Algebra, so I don't know
             how much people understood. But I think it went pretty well. Some interesting
             issues were left to be investigated, like what is the length of the maimal
             Graham series.<br />
             <br />
             Then, Ran Eilam came and gave us a longish lecture about a project he
             did for Dapey Zahav to analyze the results that were retrieved by the
             searches. It covered several distinct aspects of the project, and he
             talked about testing and good coding style extensively. We saw an
             instance of a relatively funky code (a chained data structure access
             with some ||=), which I'll let him paste here.<br />
             <br />
             Afterwards, Itzik Lerner took the stage, and talked about his experiences
             in YAPC::EU::2003. It was a fun talk, and he brought many interesting
             and funny anecdotes.

    <p>

             Around 18:50 I suggested that everyone would introduce himself which wasn't
             a brilliant idea at this time, although we learned how we'll be able to break in the
             Government offices and other similar important tasks. The problem was only that
             it took 40 minutes to go over all the people. At that time it did not seem to be a
             problem as we knew that we only have presentation for 20+40 minutes so we'll have
             plenty of time left for Avraham to talk about Tcl.<br />
             <br />
             Then came Mikhael and started to talk about threads. This was very interesting. Most
             of the people did not know anything about threads or would not admit it if they knew.
             After some 2 slides Mikhael established the ultimate message: thread are just like processes.
             You can do everything with processes that you would with threads and vice versa, they
             are nearly the same, except that they are totally different.<br />
             Though because of his presentation I think I'll be able to use threads
             but I think Mikhael should have done a shorter introduction now and then give a longer, deeper
             presentation some times later.<br />
             In the end Mikhael talked more than an hour.<br />
             <br />
             After a short break I took the stage and talked about Tcl. In general it seems to be a
             language with a very simple syntax with some very strange relation to spaces that can be
             hard to get used to for a Perl programmer. I hope I made it also clear that while we think
             Perl is the best language in the world (tm) there are areas where Tcl fits better.
             It seems that I also talked too much, unfortunately I did not look at the clock and
             by the time I finished my presentation it was already 21:45 when we had to leave the place.<br />
             <br />
             I am really sorry that I did not organize the meeting better and did not give enough stage
             for Avraham to show us how an expert Tcl programmer sees the world. I hope we'll be able to
             arrange another meeting where we'll start with Avraham.

    <p>

             The first lecture, about the POD::Index project, started at 19:00 sharp. The lecturer
             was Yehuda Berlinger. Yehuda talked about the project's goal, target audience,
             existing tools and what was done and what was still left to be done (i.e. "todo").
             At the end, some people asked questions and there was some discussion regarding the
             way the search was implemented, but I at least got the feeling that everyone agreed
             this was a worthwhile project.<br />
             <br />
             After Yehuda was done Gabor got up and gave some more background on the project and the wx GUI
             and answered some more questions about it. Personally I thought it was very
             interesting and I'm looking forward to seeing the finished product on CPAN...<br />
             <br />
             The next lecture was given by Mikhael Goikhman, and was titled "Ruby for Perl
             Programmers". Mikhael started out by introducing this fascinating new
             language, giving its highlights and some features, then continued by showing a
             simple Ruby program. From there the lecture dived into more details, and if you are
             interested the entire lecture notes can be found online so you can read them for
             yourselves (see below for the link).<br />
             <br />
             I guess the most interesting thing for me was that Mikhael showed clearly how Ruby
             was derived mainly from Perl, this later led to an observation by Gabor that Perl 6
             was meant mainly as Perl's response to Ruby. It seems that just as Ruby borrowed many
             of its features from Perl, Perl 6 will borrow back some good ideas from Ruby. This to
             my mind shows one of the best features of open source projects, the ability to
             cross-pollinate with other projects and enhance both in the process. It will be very
             interesting to see in the future which language comes out a favourite of programmers,
             but in any case both programmers and users will I'm sure come out winners from this
             healthy competition between the two languages.<br />
             <br />
             Anyway, getting back to the meeting review, because the lecture was pretty long we stopped
             in the middle for a 10 minute break and continued at 20:45.
             Some people left both during the first part of the lecture and more left during
             the break, so that after the break we remained 10 people- still a respectful number. Mikhael managed to barely wrap
             up the last slides at 21:45, when we had to close up the meeting and clear the building.
             Ran Eilam brought up the idea of going to a pub, but because this was unplanned we
             decided to postpone the pub to the next meeting, with the understanding that it would
             be announced in the mailing list in advance that this was the plan, so that people could
             plan accordingly.

    <p>

             The meeting got off to a fine start at around 18:00 when people started showing up.
             We talked for an hour and also ate and drank from the refreshments Gabor brought - Thanks Gabor! :-)<br />
             Then at 19:00 it was time for the first lecture.<br />
             The first lecture was given by Avraham Bernstein and was an introduction to
             <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/">Tcl, the Tool Command Language</a>.
             Avraham actually started in the middle of his slides, first introducing the strengths of Tcl (such as full Unicode
             support and the ability to easily create compilers, interpreters and Domain Specific Languages). This generated
             some discussion with it being pointed out that thanks to <a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a> and
             <a href="https://metacpan.org/search?q=Inline%3A%3AC">Inline::C</a> Perl had, during the last couple of years,
             gotten closer to Tcl in terms of how easy it is to expand the language.<br />
             There were a lot more slides with Avraham telling us about Tcl's history, language structure and lots more. I thought
             it was fascinating that almost everything in Tcl is a string and that there are only 11 core operators and delimiters in Tcl.
             Amazing!<br />
             At the end of his lecture Avraham opened the floor for questions, and got mostly compiler related questions from Kfir Lavi.
             At 20:05 we all cheered Avraham for a great presentation and took a 15 minute break.<br />
             <br />
             Gabor Szabo was the next speaker, his 20 minute lecture was about the
             <a href="http://qa.perl.org/phalanx/">Phalanx project</a>, using
             <a href="http://occamstoothbrush.com/perl/talks/phalanx_talk/slides/">existing slides</a>.<br />
             <br />
             The final lecture was an Introduction to
             <a href="http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming">Extreme Programming</a> (XP), given by
             <a href="http://www.cortext.co.il/">Ran Eilam</a>.
             While the lecture didn't have anything to do with Perl, Ran kept us riveted to our chairs for more than an hour
             with an entertaining yet thoughtful lecture. At the beginning of the lecture I didn't know anything about XP except
             that it exists as a buzzword, so I didn't know what to expect. Ran, a gifted speaker, managed to hook us right from the start with
             personal tales of woe from the software industry and a review of some of the worst practices in software programming
             such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big+Ball+Of+Mud">Big Ball of Mud</a>, which are alas
             all too prevalent. At times we laughed, other times we nodded our heads in
             agreement when a particular point made us remember exactly the same thing happening to us...<br />
             XP, Ran explained to us, is all about improving software engineering by taking the good practices
             in programming and "pumping them up to the extreme" - hence the name "Extreme Programming". <br />
             I was only sorry that Ran didn't get to finish his entire lecture (we ran out of time) and hope that we'll get to hear
             the rest of the lecture some other time. <br />
             <br />
             At 21:45 we wrapped up the technical meeting and as previously agreed went to a pub together.
             Actually, since we hadn't decided in advance on a place to go to and wanted a nearby place, we ended up crossing the street
             to a nearby cafe-pub. The social part of the meeting was as fun, I think, as the technical part, and the only negative points were
             the high prices and the fact that nobody brought a camera. Hmm, I wonder if any of the Israeli Perl Mongers has a digital
             camera and would be willing to bring it to the next meeting?

             <span class="summary_subheading"> Meeting Summary by Offer Kaye</span>
             </p>

             <p> When I got to the meeting around 18:05 there were already a
             group of people who had come early, and fairly quickly most of the
             rest of the people came. Gabor could not come to meeting, so
             around 18:30 Ran collected some money from everyone and went
             together with Shlomi to get some food and drink.  </p>

             <p>
             Then at 19:00 it was time for the first lecture, which was titled
             <a href="/presentations/garbage_collection_in_Perl.ppt">Garbage Collection in Perl</a> and was given by
             Shlomo Yona. From the very first slides the lecture generated a lot of discussion- garbage collection (GC) must
             be a subject close to the heart of many programmers &#x263A;<br />
             A local copy of the lecture is linked to above- if you wish to read more about GC start there, or go to the sources
             mentioned at the end of the lecture.
             Wikipedia's <a href="http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_garbage_collection/">
             Automatic Garbage Collection</a> page is also a good starting point. In addition, if you're curious about
             Perl 6's garbage collection, you can read
             <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/pdd/pdd09_gc.html">PDD 9</a> and the
             <a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/docs/dev/dod.dev.html">Dead Object Detection</a>
             page on parrotecode.org.
             </p>

             <p>
             Shlomo finished his lecture at 20:15, at which time we all cheered him for a very interesting presentation and
             took a 15 minute break.
             </p>

             <p>
             At 20:30 Ran Eilam gave a short 15 minute lecture about
             <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/writeUps/TestDrivenDevelopment/">Test Driven Development</a>
             with <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>.
             Actually, Ran didn't settle for a dry lecture, he actually gave the lecture while at the same time developing in front
             of our eyes a basic "checkbook" application written in Java, thus demonstrating at every step of the way the
             concepts he was talking about such as "test first" and <a href="http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refactoring/">
             refactoring</a>.
             The lecture was a truely impressive example of both Ran's virtuosity as a lecturer and rapid code
             developer and the ability of Eclipse to automatically refactor Java code. We were all sorry to hear that Perl cannot
             be automatically refactored in a similar manner, due to its complex syntax. Oh well, at least there is always the option
             of <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/10/09/refactoring.html">manual refactoring</a>.
             </p>

             <p>
             The final lecture was an <a href="http://www.shlomifis.org/lecture/Perl/Haskell/slides/">Introduction
             to Haskell</a> by Shlomi Fish. <a href="http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell">Haskell</a> is a
             functional programming language with support for such interesting features such as recursive functions. Like all functional
             languages its syntax is very different from Perl's, a fact which made it difficult for Shlomi to explain the examples he gave
             in the lecture. However the example code he ran was very nice, I especially liked the infinite lists code examples.
             </p>

             <p>
             Due to lack of time (as always we had to wrap up at 21:45) Shlomi did not give the entire lecture but for the interested
             the slides are linked above. More info on Haskell can also be found on the
             <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">haskell.org website</a>.
             </p>

             <p> After the technical meeting wrapped up five of us decided to
             continue the evening in a local pub together. This was a lot of
             fun, just as it was the last time, and I hope these pub evenings
             will become a tradition of the Israeli Perl Mongers.  </p>

             <p>
             <span class="summary_subheading"> Meeting Summary by Ran Eilam</span>
             </p>

             <p>
             We were sad when we realized that our fearless leader could not make the meeting. It meant we had to buy our own cakes.
             Donations were provided and indeed many cakes were eaten. Unfortunately, most people did not like the
             new <em>halva</em> flavor.
             </p>

             <p>
             Shlomo took over the formal introductions. Everyone knew everyone. It was shorter than usual,
             as it did not include Gabor's customary motivational speech, which always works for me.
             </p>

             <p>
             <strong>Garbage Collection</strong>
             </p>

             <p>
             Shlomo kicked off the meeting with a highly focused talk about garbage collection. He started with the general
             computer science problem, and ended with the Perl situation.
             One interesting point he made is that sometimes it just does not matter. Another is that it is a very old,
             well understood problem. He talked a little about computer science history and biographies.
             I would have liked to see more practical examples where GC is an issue, but perhaps there was no time.
             There were many questions during the talk, and at least 3 arguments.
             Another reference to the subject, which shows the weaken solution Shlomo talked about, and a technique using
             proxies (for when you cannot use weak refs), is at http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/08/07/proxyobject.html.
             (note - here's <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/01/07/1535206">a slashdot thread about memory allocation with some interesting and relevent posts</a> - Offer Kaye)
             </p>
             <p>
             <strong>TDD with Eclipse</strong><br />
             </p>

             <p> Next Ran Eilam gave a 7 minute talk about test driven
             development with Eclipse, focusing on how to get eclipse to write
             code for you, according to the only thing you actually do write
             (almost): the unit test.  Mikhael Goikhman was not impressed. His
             position is that people who use this will become code monkeys, and
             will not understand the code they write. Kfir wanted the Eclipse
             quick-fix feature for a Perl IDE (who doesn't?), but thought maybe
             it can be done. After we convinced him out of it, Offer voiced a
             hope that maybe a non-optimal solution, a <em>good-enough</em>
             solution, could be found. After discussion, we decided that
             probably not.  </p>

             <p>
             <strong>Haskell</strong><br />
             </p>

             <p>
             Shlomi Fish gave a computer-science-style introduction to Haskell. Now we know where the verb <em>to curry</em>
             comes from. He chose good examples, and explained the easy ones very well. We had some problems
             with the more complex. It seems functional programming is incompatible with how most of the il
             mongers think. This makes it hard to learn, as you must change the way you think..
             The run-length encoding example was particularly succinct, and I wait with anticipation to see its Perl
             twin. Generally, if you give a foreign language talk to the mongers, try to connect it as much as
             possible to Perl.
             </p>

             <p> <em>Update</em>: Shlomi Fish and Mikhael Goikhman have
             provided Perl <a
             href="http://mail.perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2003-December/003635.html">imperative</a>
             and <a
             href="http://mail.perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2003-December/003636.html">functional</a>
             solutions respectively.  Thus we are able to see that this is a
             problem that lends itself better to a functional solution.  Which
             opens questions like: <em>what kinds of problems are best solved
             in a functional way?</em> and others, that will be answered if
             someone does the <strong>Functional Programming in Perl</strong>
             talk that Shlomo requested.  </p>

             <p> As always, my critique of Shlomi is that for some reason,
             despite overwhelming evidence, he thinks we are way smarter than
             we really are.  </p>

             <p><strong>Godfather</strong></p>

             <p> Some of us headed for the bar. The owners were very nice to
             us, and Offer had some bizzare smoked sardine mezzet.  It was
             strange talking Perl with this funky fish staring at me. The
             problem went away when Offer disposed of the head.  Because Migo
             requested, we agreed to sit outside, as he had obviously not been
             outside for many months.<br /> Turns out the pub is a
             reincarnation of a super-sleazy 25 year old Haifa pub in the
             harbor, usually visited by sailors and the women who love them. In
             my youth I had some great fun there.<br /> There was an argument
             about pair programming, talk about verilog text editors, and many
             other subjects I cannot possibly remember. They are washed forever
             by the sands of time, as is this review.

             </p>
