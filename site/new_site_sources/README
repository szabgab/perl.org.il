The site sources are under the directory "new_site_sources", and the site
itself is (by default) under "new_site_sources/site".  If this changed and we
forgot to update this README, please let us know :-)

The sources use HTML::Template to build the site, so to build the site you
should first have it installed.

The main command to run is:
        perl update_site.pl

This script simply calls the seperate Perl scripts that do the actual work.
There are currently 3 such scripts: books.pl, meetings.pl and
main.pl.

* books.pl - Creates the individual book pages under the books directory.
  We don't have the library any more so this is a bit irrelevant now.

* meetings.pl - Creates the individual meeting pages under the meetings
  directory.

* main.pl - Builds the rest of the site's HTML pages.



HOWTO:

1) Add a new meeting or move it from future to past meetings:
   - Add entry to the %meetingsXXXX hash in MeetingsDataXXXX.pm
   (where XXXX = 4 digit year) or update the relevant entry there.

2) Add a book review:


3) Add a new page called xyz.html:
   - Create the template for the page in the templates directory
     (a copy of misc_content.tmpl can be a good start)
         "xyz_content.tmpl" would be a good name.

   - In templats/main.tmpl add an entry for conditionally including the newly
     created template. The condition will be set in the main.pl script.
   - In main.pl add the name of the page to the list that generates the
     @outfiles at the top of the files (add xyz.html ) in the
     get_unique_params subroutine add a new block like:

<<<
     elsif ($file =~ /xyz.html$/) {
        block
     }
>>>

         And within that block set the various values to what fits your
     new page. Copy-paste another section to get started.

   - Add an entry in the nav_bar variable in the "nav_bar" template
     parameter (in "meetings.pl") if this page should show up in the upper
     navigation bar.
