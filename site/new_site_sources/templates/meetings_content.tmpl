     Apart from the mailing list, the main avenue for Israel Perl Mongers for
     the exchange of information and ideas are the Israel.pm monthly meetings.
     <br />
     Since June 2002 we have held regular monthly meetings, usually on the first
     Thursday of the month. During these meetings we meet, socialize for a while,
     then we have around 2 presentations about topics that interest us and finally we
     go to a nearby local cafe/pub to talk some more (and drink beer ;-).
     <br />
     The level of the presentations varies a lot - from
     presentations fit for people who have used been using Perl for only 2 months, to
     advanced material suitable for experienced programmers.
     <br />
     The level of the speakers also varies - for some of them this is the first time
     they give any kind of presentation, others are experienced trainers. All speakers
     are volunteers who have agreed to share their knowledge and passion with their
     fellow Perl Mongers.
     <br />
     Lectures can last from 5 minutes ("lightning talks") to 90 minute long talks,
     and can be a simple "lecture style" presentation, or one with lots of interaction
     from the audience.
     <br />
     In addition to the presentations and the ability to meet and talk face to face with
     other Perl users.
<!--
     Perl Mongers who attend the meetings may also borrow (and return)
     books from the <a href="library.html">Israel.pm library</a>.

     <br />
     Meetings are announced on our <a href="/mailing_lists.html">mailing lists</a>.

Ynon Perek - <b>“The Vim Text Editor for Perl Developers”</b>
</p>

<p>
Editing text takes a lot of time. By using and customising a good text editor,
we can get more work done in less time. In this talk I’m going to take Vim and
show how a Perl developer can get a lot more productive by using it. We’ll
start with a plain out-of-the-box Vim installation and add plugins and
customisations to create a perl oriented workflow.

<b>Using Linux and Perl for Testing Hardware</b> by Ori Idan
</p>
<p>
Every electronic circuit must be checked before it is delivered to the
customer. The check should perform a functional test of all the circuit’s
functions. In mass production, an automatic test is a must. In this talk, I
will talk about the implementation of some functional test systems which I have
implemented for several customers. All these systems use Linux as their
operating systems and Perl for the actual tests.

<p>
<b>How to Welcome Strangers to Perl.</b> - Erez Schatz
</p>
<p>
Perl and its subsets and extensions have a very unfriendly to outsiders reputation.
Part of it is intentional, but other arrives from cultural and personal differences
between many in the current communities and those who wish to learn, or get answers
and support in Perl, Perl 5, Modern Perl 5, and the CPAN and its main Projects.
I will attempt to map some of these relations in an attempt that bridge the two sides.

<b>Asynchronous Programming FTW!</b> by Sawyer X
</p>
<p>
The new age is all about non-blocking asynchronous creative responsive
deconstructive refactored decoupled conjectured applications. If you're not on
the event loop wagon loop, you're missing out!
</p>
<p>
What the hell am I talking about? Am I just drunk? How many of the above words
are totally made-up? These questions and more will be answered at this talk!

<p>
<b>Rx.pl - Reactive Extensions for Perl</b> by Ran Eilam
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/eilara/Rx.pl">github.com</a>
</p>
<p>
A library for composing async programs. Because writing async code is hard,
but working with Perl lists is easy. Lets turn events into lists, and reap
the benefits:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Elegant async programming without callback nesting, using operators we
  all know from working with Perl lists.</li>
<li>Managing and coordinating events, e.g. start an HTTP request when timeout
  on key press if previous HTTP request was OK and arrived in the last
  10 seconds.</li>
<li>Programming with stream transformations, instead of objects and methods-
  say hello to beautiful functional designs with well defined state and
  side-effects . Replace boring UML diagrams with fun marble diagrams.</li>
<li>Stop writing and rewriting retry, timeout, throttle, buffer, window,
  counters, caching, and aggregate functions for each project. Instead
  create your processes as observables, then enjoy a rich library of
  existing operators.</li>
</ul>

The Internet is changing direction. More and more web-sites want to
notify their visitors in real time about changes that happen on the server (for instance, a
different visitor uploaded a photo). A library called Socket IO unifies all the various ways to send
messages from the server to the computers of the visitors and allows the programmer to write an
Internet application that gets updated in real time. vti implemented the library in Perl as Pocket::IO.
</p>

In this talk, I will present the ideas behind Real Time Web, including code excerpts in Perl which
use the library in order to create interactive sites.

<p><b><a href="http://szabgab.com/">Gabor Szabo</a>: Refactoring Perl code (20-40 minutes)</b><br />
Code refactoring is "disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code,
altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior". It is needed
to ensure your code remains readable while growing in size and scope.
</p>
<p>
It is needed if you have some old code base that needs improvement and after every
period of intense development when you "did not have the time to properly design your code".
</p>
<p>
There are several patterns in refactoring, some of them you might already practice without knowing the name.
</p>
<p>
The most obvious is when you use a variable $x and suddenly you realize it could have a more descriptive name.
If you change all the occurances of $x to this better name, without changing anything else in the code, that's already refactoring.
</p>
<p>
We will see several patterns for refactoring Perl code. We see examples doing them manually and we'll try to automate them as well.
</p>
<p><b>Mini Hackathon</b><br />

</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Visualizing the brain of Vim</b> by Ran Eilam -
You loved him in "Game frameworks with SDL, Moose and Coro", you cried over
his performance in the after-meeting get-togethers, and you will absolutely
adore him in "Visualizing the brain of Vim". All-star legend Ran Eilam will
talk to us (both beginners and experts) about Vim and how to fathom this
incredible beast. I warn you, the first two lines in the audience will be
damaged by Emacs flames.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>A bunch of modules which made sense writing</b> - by Sawyer X:
I'm going to cover some utility modules I've written, why they were written
and when they are useful. At the end, you'll have to judge whether they were
worth writing at all.  There will be voting booths available!
(We'll cover Algorithm::Diff::Callback, App::Genpass, Data::PowerSet::Hash
and Module::Version.)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>To upgrade or not to upgrade, Perl 5.6 vs. Perl 5.14</b> - ik vs. Sawyer X:
A source of great concern in the Perl users community is whether to use an
up-to-date Perl and what version should be considered "too old". On one
hand, we have the management that wants as little cost and changes as possible
(sometimes along with systems administrators), and on the other hand, the
developer who wants to use the latest technologies, and is often
stuck on obsolete systems.
</p>

<p>
In light of this serious consideration, we're going to take turns poking at
each other with a stick, wearing funny hats, damning the unbelievers and
heretics until they submit to one side: 5.6 or 5.14!
</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>
The entrance to the meeting is free-of-charge, and everyone are welcome to
attend. See you there!
