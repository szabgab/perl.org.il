      <p>
     Apart from the mailing list, the main avenue for Israel Perl Mongers for
     the exchange of information and ideas are the Israel.pm monthly meetings.
     <br />
     Since June 2002 we have held regular monthly meetings, usually on the first
     Thursday of the month. During these meetings we meet, socialize for a while,
     then we have around 2 presentations about topics that interest us and finally we
     go to a nearby local cafe/pub to talk some more (and drink beer ;-).
     <br />
     The level of the presentations varies a lot - from
     presentations fit for people who have used been using Perl for only 2 months, to
     advanced material suitable for experienced programmers.
     <br />
     The level of the speakers also varies - for some of them this is the first time
     they give any kind of presentation, others are experienced trainers. All speakers
     are volunteers who have agreed to share their knowledge and passion with their
     fellow Perl Mongers.
     <br />
     Lectures can last from 5 minutes ("lightning talks") to 90 minute long talks,
     and can be a simple "lecture style" presentation, or one with lots of interaction
     from the audience.
     <br />
     In addition to the presentations and the ability to meet and talk face to face with
     other Perl users, Perl Mongers who attend the meetings may also borrow (and return)
     books from the <a href="library.html">Israel.pm library</a>.
     <br />
     Meetings are announced on our <a href="mailing_lists.html">mailing lists</a>.
