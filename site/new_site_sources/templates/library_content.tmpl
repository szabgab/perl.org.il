         The library of the Israeli Perl Mongers includes nearly 80 books, mostly about Perl,
     programming, and other computer related subjects. The books are available as a special
     service for our members, and can be borrowed, free of any charge, by coming to our
     <a href="meetings.html">meetings</a>. Specifically:
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>To order a book, check its availability in the list below.</li>
         <li>
        Contact our librarian,
        <a href="mailto:libraryHATESpaM@perl.org.il" title="Email the librarian">Thomas Maier</a>,
        and request the book.
     </li>
         <li>Show up at the next Israel.pm meeting and pickup the book.</li>
         <li>
        Read the book and write a review (you can email the review as simple text, or
        intersepted with simple HTML formatting tags, e.g.
        &lt;b&gt;<strong>bold text</strong>&lt;/b&gt;, if you want).<br />
        While this is not compulsory, it would be highly appriciated, as these reviews are one
        of the major motivations for our sponsors to continue donating books to our library.
     </li>
         <li>Return the book by coming to a meeting and returning the book to the librarian.</li>
         <li>
        If you want a book but it is currently held by another user, contact the librarian so
        that he can add you to the waiting list for that book.
     </li>
      </ol>
