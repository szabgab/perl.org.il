      <h1 id="introduction" style="border-top: none; padding-top: 0;">Introduction</h1>
      <p>
         <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a> is the term used to describe both
         the participants of certain groups of Perl users, as well as the organization which is composed of the
         loose association of said Perl User Groups from all over the world.<br />

         Perl Monger groups have different goals, but all are composed of Perl users who like to
         talk with and meet their fellow Perl Mongers.<br />

         Specifically, the Israeli Perl Mongers (Israel.pm) is the Israeli Perl user group registered at the
         International Perl Mongers site.
         It is composed of Perl users of various levels, from total beginners who have yet to write "Hello, World"
         to veteran Perl programmers -- all are welcome.<br />
         The goals of the Israeli Perl Mongers are first and foremost to
         facilitate communication and mutual help between Israeli Perl Mongers, and secondly to advance
         the usage of Perl in Israel and to disseminate information about our favourite programming
         language to the programming community in Israel.<br />

         To fulfill its goals, Israel.pm:
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            Has built <a href="index.html">this site</a>, to host archives, local content and to
            feature local Perl related news items.
         </li>
         <li>
            Has several <a href="mailing_lists.html">mailing lists</a> dedicated to Perl.
            This is the main avenue of participation for the majority of Israeli Perl users.
         </li>
         <li>
            Holds <a href="meetings.html">monthly meetings</a> that feature 2 or more Perl (or programming
            in general) related lectures. For the Israeli Perl Mongers, this is the main avenue by which
            we meet and socialize.
         </li>
         <li>
            Has held <a href="yapc.html">yearly conferences</a> (for the past 2 years, with
            hopefully more to come), through which Israel.pm has exposed a wider audience to a
            full day of back to back Perl lectures given by members of the community.
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
         Anyone may become a member of Israel.pm, by simply registering to the mailing list.
         Registration is free, but is required to keep the mailing list spam free.
         Participation in the monthly meetings is also free.
      </p>

      <h1 id="officers">Current Officers</h1>
      <p>
         Israel.pm is lead by <a href="http://www.szabgab.com/">Gabor Szabo</a>, who is also its
         founder. When he is not acting in his capacity as Israel.pm's fearless leader, Gabor
         manages his own Perl training company, appropriatly named
         <a href="https://szabgab.com/">Perl Training Israel</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         Until about the beginning of 2004, nearly all of the routine work involving the running and
         organization of Israel.pm has fallen on the shoulders of Gabor Szabo. Since then, several
         Perl Mongers have stepped up to help him run various aspects of the group:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <a href="mailto:library_HATESPAM_@perl.org.il" title="Email the Librarian">Thomas Maier</a>
            serves as Israel.pm's librarian, keeping track of who has which book and
            updating the library page as required, and bringing requested books to the meetings.
         </li>
    <li>
            <a href="http://okaye.esmartweb.com/">Offer Kaye</a>
            serves as the English PR officer for Israel.pm. He is responsible for sending
       meeting announcements and other PR related
            materials to English-language websites and mailing lists.
         </li>
         <li>
         The webmasters are Gabor and
         <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a>.
             Email the <a href="mailto:web_HATESPAM_master@perl.org.il" title="Email the Webmaster">webmaster</a>.
         </li>
      </ul>

      <h1 id="history">History</h1>
      <p>
         The Israeli Perl mailing list was originally setup by Gabor to allow students who attended a
         recent Perl course given by Gabor to ask him further questions. The
         <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2001-April/000000.html">first email</a> to the list
         was sent on Friday, April 27, 2001. <br/>
         From these humble beginnings Israel.pm has grown to be one of the largest and most active
         <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Users groups</a> in the world, with hundreds
         subscribed to the mailing list and an increasing volume of emails
         <a href="mailing_lists.html#statistics">sent each year</a>.<br />
         The weekly Perl meetings have also been progressing nicely. The initial meeting, which took place
         at March 18, 2002, was a small meeting with only 6 people, no set agenda and no regular place to
         meet. However, since about June 2003 <a href="http://www.d.co.il/">Dapey Zahav</a> have kindly
         donated the use of a room and overhead projector. Thanks to this set location, great participation by
         Perl Mongers willing to prepare lectures, and the organization of Gabor Szabo, the Israeli Perl
         Mongers have since then met regularly, with an attendence of usually about 15-25 people.
         Recently the Perl Mongers have started to follow-up the technical session with a social one, going
         together after the lectures are over to a nearby pub. Hopefully this will continue and become a
         tradition :-)

      <p>
         The new Israel.pm site is an
         <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/HTML-Template">HTML::Template</a> based site,
         with the look being based on
         the <a href="http://www.oswd.org/viewdesign.phtml?id=1192">Gila</a> template, which was
         downloaded from the <a href="http://www.oswd.org/">Open Source Web Design</a> site.<br />
         The site sources are managed using <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/perl.org.il">a GitHub repository</a> - see <a href="https://guides.github.com/">their tutorials</a> for how to contribute.
