    <p>

             The Feb. 2005 meeting got off to what I thought was a great start,
             with several new people showing up - I hope they enjoyed their first
             Israel.pm meeting and that they'll be back for more :)<br />
         By the time the first lecture was to begin, we had nearly 20 people in the room (several late
         comers showed up after 19:00), however one important person had not yet showed up - Liraz was
         running late due to transportation problems. So Gabor got a chance to show us his brand-new
         module and website,  <a href="http://metacpan.org/module/CPAN::Forum/">CPAN::Forum</a>.
         The site, <a href="http://www.cpanforum.com/">
         http://www.cpanforum.com/</a>, provides a central place to discuss matters relating to
         CPAN modules. each module has its own forum, including links to the search.cpan.org
         page and related pages. In fact, each module page on search.cpan.org now has a link
         directly to its forum page on cpanforum.com, which is very handy. The idea behind
         CPAN::Forum is that instead of having to register to a seperate mailing list for each
         module one is interested in (i.e. wants to discuss), you now need to register to only one
         site. Gabor didn't get a chance to actually show code, since at about 19:15
         Liraz showed up and Gabor relinquished the floor to him.<br />
         <br />
         <a href="http://liraz.org/">Liraz</a> is a long-time Perl programmer who recently
         discovered the joys of Python and has decided to try to convert other Perl programmers to
         the use of Python. Leaving my personal opinion about Python aside, Liraz gave a nice
         review of why he thinks Python is a better language, some features of Python, things
         it has in common with Perl and things that make it special and finally why we should all
         start programming in Python. Right from the start, it was obvious that the members of
         Israel.pm were not about to agree to his arguments without some heavy convincing, as
         Liraz was constantly interrupted with questions and arguments. In spite of this, Liraz
         managed to finish his talk and we even had some time at the end for a short Q&amp;A.<br />
         <br />
         Although it was not planned, Yuli asked to talk for about 10 minutes about a service he
         was promoting called <a href="http://www.bannershift.com/">BannerShift</a>, a text-ad
         banner exchange service. This doesn't really have anything to do with Perl, except for
         the fact that many Perl programmers are also webmasters...<br />
         <br />
         The technical part of the meeting wrapped-up around 21:45, and around 10 of us continued
         to a new place called "The Sil-Bar", across the street from Dapey Zahav.
         The atmosphere was nice, the drinks okay and so was the food, and the conversation
         was interesting. In short, we all had a lot of good time :-)<br />
         <br />
         Thanks and see you next time!

    <p>

             First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Roman
             Parparov for the great work he did in arranging a room for Israel.pm
             to meet in. This meeting could not have taken place without his efforts.<br />
             <br />
             The first Israel.pm meeting in several months got off to a fine start, as several
             people showed up early. There was a little crisis with the plastic cups
             (the crisis being that I forgot to bring some with me :-)) but Roman rose
             to the challenge yet again and proved that nothing will stop a determined
             Perl Monger :) So we had cups in which to drink, tasty bourekas, and all
             was good.<br />
             <br />
             The first lecture, by Gabor Szabo, was actually part lecture about the perl.org.il
             site and part code review. Gabor began with some motivation about why a
             code review is a good thing (no need to convince the audience, they were
             sold) followed by a quick review of the templating system we chose for
             the site, <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/HTML-Template">HTML::Template</a>.
             Gabor continued (in spite of frequent interruptions by the audience, including
             me - I couldn't help it :-)) with a review of the scripts used to build the
             site. This is where things got interesting, as several people made very good
             and pertinant suggestions about the code, which Gabot promptly added to the
             TODO file. Hopefully some of those suggestions will actually get implemented
             :-). I thought the code review was a great success, in spite of being too
             short in time - the relative beginners in the crowd got to see working
             Perl code and hear it reviewed, analyzed and disected; the more experienced
             mongers got to help advance the site by making suggestions that if implemented
             will certainly help; and I and Gabor got a lot to do :-)<br />
             <br />
             The second lecture was by Uri Bruck, the title was "
             <a href="http://bruck.israel.net/perl/perl2queen3.sxi">Perl to Queen's
             Level 3</a>". Something of the code review spirit of the first session
             must have leaked over to Uri's lecture, because Uri was frequently
             interrupted with comments and questions about his code. Part of the reason
             I guess was that Uri used OO code, and OO is always a controversial subject,
             both in regards to when to use it and how to use it. In any case, I thought
             the lecture itself was very interesting and especially liked all the pictures
             Uri showed of chess variant examples - some very nice boards :-).<br />
             <br />
             After the technical meeting part, most of us continued to a "Coffee-to-go"
             place nearby (near gate #2 of TAU I think) and continued to chat and
             socialize. As usual this was fun and I enjoyed both the company and the
             beer :-)<br />
             <br />
             That's all for now, see you all next time.

    <p>

             We gathered in the second floor. When I arrived only Uri Bruck was there. We
             started discussing stuff, among it:
             <br /><br />
             1. Whether Open Source and the Creative Commons were Socialistic, Communistic,
             pro-Capitalistic, non-Capitalistic, anti-Capitalistic, etc. Later on, we
             decided that it did not matter whether it was Socialistic or not, as long as
             we all agreed that Open Source was "good for the Jews".
             <br /><br />
             2. We discussed the eBay's acquisition of shopping.com (formerly dealtime) for
             several hundred millions dollars (which I surprisingly did not hear about -
             can anyone give me a URL?).
             <br /><br />
             I probably have a lot to say about #1, but I'll leave it to another message.
             We helped Roman carry the Bourekas and Beverages, and then enjoyed eating
             them. Then Roman's presentation started.
             <br /><br />
             Roman's presentation was about using Perl to construct and manage a Swiss
             Tournament. He covered a lot of the theory and then went on to cover the Perl
             implementation (without showing any code).
             <br /><br />
             Then we had a break. A new guy (Something Perelmutter) showed up and we talked
             with him. He now studies Mechanical Engineering in Tel Aviv University, and
             is a Reserve Student (Atudai). He is heavily involved in the Bney-Yehuda
             Football group - started as their webmaster and now is involved with the
             children. We touched a bit about how it was relatively unusual for hackers
             (even male) to like spectator sports, and Offer asked him if he can get
             tickets to the game for his co-workers.
             <br /><br />
             We also discusses tabs vs. spaces, whether political or philosophical
             discussions were boring or not, who convinces who in such discussions, etc.
             There also was an interesting insight about the fact that the Hamakor Bylaws
             caused many discussions to require the people who conveyed opinions to tell
             how much exactly did they contributed to open-source.
             <br /><br />
             Then came Shlomo's presentation. The slides are available online (URL?) and
             the problem was very interesting, and there was a lot of involvement from the
             listeners. I suggested a solution to the problem which was different from
             Shlomo's solution, and also could be generalized. Shlomo's solution was
             considerably more complex, and some people wondered how he could think of it
             At the end of the presentation, we took out the screen, and I wrote the Perl
             code for my solution. We had 30 minutes to do the same for Shlomo's solution,
             but we decided against it.
             <br /><br />
             Then Offer asked how many people wanted to go to the cafe, but only three or
             four people wanted to go, so he decided to skip it.
             <br /><br />
             The meeting was attended by 8 or 9 people, which was relatively low, and even
             many regulars did not attend.

             First of all, the
         <a href="/presentations/stas_bekman_mod_perl-2.0-tutorial/mod_perl-2.0-tutorial-slides.pdf.gz">slides</a> and
         <a href="/presentations/stas_bekman_mod_perl-2.0-tutorial/mod_perl-2.0-tutorial-handouts.pdf.gz">handouts</a>
         from the lecture
         are available here. Download and enjoy.
         <br /><br />
             Stas and I arrived just after the beginning of the assembly, so most people had already
         arrived by the time we got there. Luckily for us there were not too many, so there
         were many bourekas left over... :)
             <br /><br />
             Stas began by explaining that he usualy requires 5-6 hours to cover the entire
         tutorial, so since we only had about 2 hours there was only time to skim over the
         top. So we decided to go over the HTTP protocol handler, filters and if time permitted
         some of the other protocol handlers.
             <br /><br />
             Stas began with a short overview of installing mod_perl (you need Apache2 installed).
         Pinkhas asked about the benefits of static compilation, Stas said there weren't any.
         I asked about adding a PREFIX argument to the "perl Makefile.pl" stage, Stas said
         there was no problem with that.
             <br /><br />
             The lecture continued with a quick overview of some of the new features in mod_perl2
         compared to mod_perl. Basically the real power of mod_perl2 is the access to Apache's
         API - over 400 functions are accessible using mod_perl2.
             <br /><br />
             There was a lot more to the lecture, more than I can remember now, but all of
         it was very interesting and informative. Also during a 10 minute break we had
         Stas showed some pictures he took while he was in Honolulu, those were
         simply amazing :)
             <br /><br />
             After the technical meeting most of us continued to the nearby coffee-shop
         where we drank beer and talked some more about mod_perl, Perl in general and
         other stuff. It was fun and tasty, and I'm looking forward to the next meeting...
         See you all there! :)

                        Perl 5 is a great language. It has a few quirks and unfortunate gotchas,
                        though; and although it is well-known for its versatility and flexibility,
                        the Perl 5 community wants something better.
                        <br /><br />
                        The good news is that Perl 6 is coming. The Pugs Project has given
                        language design and implementation a huge push forward.
                        <br /><br />
                        In this talk we'll showcase a few language constructs that make the
                        programmer's life easier, side by side with Perl 5 code.

    <p>

                Can't beat the university surrounding. It is much more inspiring to talk Perl and eat burekas
                when surrounded by live satellite imagery and cases with moon rocks, than when surrounded
                with aging yellow-pages books. And there was plenty of fine refreshments for all.
                <br /><br />
                After a long absence from these meetings, it was easy to remember why I started coming here
                in the first place.
                <br /><br />
                1st talk was about "Visual Perl/Tk". A beginner oriented tool for building Tk GUIs visually.
                He built it. A reasonably convincing argument was made about the need for such a tool.
                Then we saw a nice demo. The code generated looks excellent. There is limited support for
                theming. I especially liked the various types of online help he showed- there is an
                internal help area where tips are shown, and you get external POD windows. Great for
                learning PerlTk.
                <br /><br />
                He was thinking of round trip code generation and other stuff, but then we got into a long
                session of RTL unicode hacking in Tk. The words "locale", "UTF8", and "BIDI" were thrown
                around, and strange characters appeared on the screen. This specific topic seems to be a
                major obsession with several mongers. It keeps appearing in every meeting. Or it could be
                just coincidence.
                <br /><br />
                Then came Gaal's talk about Perl6 for Perl5 people. The talk was great and left us with
                an appetite for more of the same. Each slide had some Perl5 vs. Perl6 code. The Pugs
                interpreter was used for demos and answering the many questions that were asked. He
                specifically focused on existing Pelr5 pains and their solution. He could have ranted
                about the sexier features of Perl6 (continuations, roles, etc.), but the approach he
                took was much better.
                <br /><br />
                Migo and others asked some difficult questions, which always started with
                "but can I do...?". As expected the answer was always yes. Offer focused on questions of
                the type "but can I do ... as I did in Perl5?". Again the answers were always yes.
                <br /><br />
                Secondary sigils, adverbial modifiers, topicalization, hyper operators, the splat operator...
                <br /><br />
                Some notable quotes:
                <br /><br />
                "The behavior in this case is well defined, or will be well defined"
                "Perl code that has MAGNIVUT (stealing quality)"
                "Perl5, when seen in this way, is slightly clunky"
                <br /><br />
                He promised a talk about the Perl6 project. I can hardly wait.
                <br /><br />
                Then came the bomb: Larry Wall and Autrijus Tang are coming to the next YAPC in Israel.
                <br /><br />
                Then we went to the coffee house, and there too talked about Perl.
                <br /><br />
                See you next time.

                        So you've heard about Perl 6 and know you might want it. But making a
                        language sounds like a complex project. When would you get it? How is
                        it being made, anyway? Who's who, how are things coordinated, and can
                        anyone join in? (yes!)
                        In this talk we'll describe the implementation process of Perl 6,
                        hilighting Pugs, the experimental interpreter that turned into one of
                        the hottest Open Source projects of the past few years.
