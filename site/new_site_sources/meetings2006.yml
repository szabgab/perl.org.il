    <p>
    If we were doing meeting ratings, this one would be off the charts. We
    laughed, we cried, and even learned a thing or two. It had all the right
    ingredients, except maybe the (now historical) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourekas">Burekas</a> bit.
    </p>

    <p>
    The 1st talk was under the "Testing" theme. That is, if you are foolish
    enough to categorize Gabor.
    </p>

    <p>
    Gabor started with the usual: "I have no presentation".
    </p>

    <p>
    However, he did have an idea (surprise!): get everyone to pool their
    brains and add value to a CPAN module.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the follwing 40 minutes, we chose a CPAN module from
    <a href="http://ali.as/">Adam Kennedy</a>'s
    list (it was perfect for us: high quality, lots of choice, open repository),
    went through the docs and tests in depth, added a couple of tests, ran
    coverage before and after, analyzed specific branch coverage issues,
    solved them, committed, and finally solved a subversion conflict in the
    Changes file.
    </p>

    <p>
    In short, we pooled our brains and added value to a CPAN module. QED.
    </p>

    <p>
    Testing something like File::HomeDir poses unique problems, and
    excellent solutions were offered to those problems. Thomas Maier suggested
    mocking linux, and the rest of the known UNIVERSE, to get multiplatform tests
    that can be run on a uniform platform. There goes another excuse for that
    red square in Devel::Cover's report.
    </p>

    <p>
    The biggest thing I learned, was how incredibly easy it can be to add
    Kwalitee, perhaps even Quality, to a random CPAN module. People keep asking
    me: how do I get to be a good developer? How do I prove to prospective
    employers that I can write automated tests? Documenation? Just pick a CPAN
    module. If you want to start REAL easy, take a look at one of Adam Kennedy's
    modules. From what Gabor showed us, it is a great place to start.
    </p>

    <p>
    Due to time constraints, all we got to do was add a couple of tests.
    They passed, and we moved on to the next talk:
    </p>

    <p>
    Doron Abraham chose the "Humans Building Software" theme, and lead a
    sometimes funny, sometimes sad, discussion focusing on
    manager &harr; developer communications in a software team. Apparently, as
    someone who has done both, he claims that this "communications" thing, can
    actually go wrong. Terribly, terribly, wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
    It was wise of him to focus on the thorns and not the roses, for this is
    how you get a good response from the il mongers. We love the dark side. And
    it is educational, so we need not feel guilty.
    </p>

    <p>
    The talk was structured into several iterations. Each iteration
    revolved around a real event, recounted from not only the memory of Doron,
    but from the collective hive mind of everyone there, since everybody had these
    memories.
    </p>

    <p>
    A good one which everybody present experienced was (manager &rarr;
    developer):
    </p>

    <p>
    "Hey You! Stop what you're doing, switch context, and fix this urgent
    bug for client X. Do it quick and dirty, cause I need it yesterday. Don't
    worry, for THIS FEATURE WILL NEVER CHANGE. Just hard code everything."
    </p>

    <p>
    When you return from lunch, all geared up to implement that perfect solution
    you just found to this surprise problem, Manager is waiting with a new context
    switch, to a new patch, even more urgent, for a feature that will NEVER CHANGE.
    The solution required by the new patch requires a change to the earlier patch,
    which was supposed to NEVER CHANGE.
    </p>

    <p>
    And there were many others just as delightful.
    </p>

    <p>
    Then Doron pointed everyone to the issues raised by this unpleasent experience,
    and everyone countered by shouting ideas, memories, theories, debunkings,
    quotes, convictions, and everything else they could think of. We went way
    overtime, yet did not go through all his slides.
    </p>

    <p>
    This went on for several iterations, all with the same basic structure, and
    there was much laughter. Perhaps even some genuine sadness at our sorry state,
    and our continuing dysfunctionality in trying to change it.
    </p>

    <p>
    As always, the "Humans and Software" themed talks are a hit with the Israeli
    mongers, even if they are only (very) indirectly about Perl.
    </p>

    <p>
    Perl6 was mentioned approximately 10 times. The anticipation is part of
    the fun.
    </p>

    <p>
    See you next time, and thanks to Uri Bruck for helping out with the
    English.

    <p>
    When we gathered, some of us discussed
    <a href="http://metacpan.org/module/Moose">Moose</a>, which is the
    Perl 6-like OOP system for Perl 5. We discussed how as opposed to Spiffy,
    it still required extracting the $self object instance, and then how to cancel
    this behaviour on a one-function-basis in Spiffy.
    </p>
    <p>
    Yoram Shitrit gave an engaging presentation about how he makes use of Perl in
    his banking consulting company. He said Perl was very suitable for these kind
    of things, and its open source nature was a big advantage because he could
    fix things himself if there was a bug. He further claimed that his company
    knew how to give very good estimates for the projects they performed and that
    their performance fullfilled these estimates precisely.
    </p>

    <p>
    The highlight of his presentation was
    a program they wrote in Perl to analyse the TTY conversations of brokers,
    and try to deduce what was the financial outcome of this conversation. He said
    they were able to do that in a high percentage of the cases.
    </p>

    <p>
    Next on the agenda was Doron Abram's presentation about "Meeting and Your
    Stupid Boss". This presentation which started an active discussion and ended
    up a long time after the schedule, covered the issue of meetings (or
    "Yeshivoth") in a software company. Many things were covered, among them:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Off-topic discussions (ski, politics etc.), and how involving they are
    </li>
    <li>
    Someone said that if he sees that the meeting goes nowhere he simply leaves,
    which started an active discussion.
    </li>
    <li>
    There was a discussion about hallway meetings, and how effective they were.
    </li>
    <li>
    There were a story about a meeting where everyone came happy with, and made
    a lot of good decisions, only to be later completely reverted by decisions from
    the parent office in the U.S.
    </li>
    <li>
    After another such "successful" meeting, the people who've been there realised
    they discussed something completely different.
    </li>
    <li>
    And so on.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Here is some other fallout from the meeting: <a href="http://perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2006-November/008291.html">"Optimizing Meetings for Fun"</a>,
    and
    <a href="http://perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2006-November/008297.html">"Implicit
    $self variable without Source Filters"</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    To sum up - we had a lot of fun and laughed a lot. We didn't go to a café
    afterwards and instead each got a ride back home.
